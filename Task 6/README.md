## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to classify the famous **Iris dataset** into its respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

The work is divided into:
1. **Dataset Preparation** – Loading and exploring the Iris dataset.
2. **Model Building** – Training a KNN classifier.
3. **Evaluation** – Generating classification reports and performance metrics.
4. **Interview Preparation** – Documenting important theoretical concepts related to KNN and classification.

## 🚀 Steps Performed
- Loaded the `Iris.csv` dataset.
- Performed data preprocessing and normalization.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained a KNN classifier with optimal `k` value.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Saved classification report to PDF.
- Created an **Interview Questions** document covering theoretical concepts.

Do you want me to make this **README.md** also include the actual *interview questions* from your PDF so the whole folder becomes self-contained? That way, you won’t have to open two separate files.
