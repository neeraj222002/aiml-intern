## Overview

This project demonstrates building and evaluating a **binary classifier** using Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It also contains interview preparation material covering theoretical concepts and formulas.

## Steps Performed

1. **Dataset**

   * Located in `dataset/data.csv`
   * Used for training and evaluating the model.

2. **Notebook**

   * `breastCancer4.ipynb` contains code for:

     * Loading and preprocessing the dataset
     * Splitting into train/test sets
     * Standardizing features
     * Fitting a Logistic Regression model
     * Evaluating with metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC
     * Threshold tuning

3. **Interview Preparation**

   * `INTERVIEW QUESTIONS.pdf` explains:

     * Logistic vs Linear regression
     * Sigmoid function and formula
     * Precision, recall, F1-score
     * ROC-AUC curve and interpretation
     * Confusion matrix components
     * Handling imbalanced classes
     * Choosing thresholds
     * Multi-class logistic regression
