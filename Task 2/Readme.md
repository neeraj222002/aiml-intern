## 🎯 Project Objective

Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to discover insights, detect patterns, and prepare the data for further machine learning tasks.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for plotting and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

---

## 📌 Key EDA Steps Covered

1. **Loading & Cleaning Data**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms to understand distributions
   - Boxplots to detect outliers and spread

3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Pairplots to visualize relationships

4. **Detecting Skewness**
   - Histogram and skewness values

5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots on numerical features

6. **Multicollinearity Check**
   - Correlation matrix and heatmap
