# Tree-Based Models on Heart Disease Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **tree-based models** (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for classification on the **Heart Disease dataset**.  
It also includes interview preparation material related to Decision Trees, Random Forests, and related ML concepts.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Graphviz** – Decision Tree visualization

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** → `heart.csv`
2. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier** and visualize using Graphviz
3. **Analyze overfitting** by controlling tree depth
4. **Train Random Forest** and compare accuracy with Decision Tree
5. **Interpret Feature Importances**
6. **Evaluate models** using Cross-Validation
7. **Generate report & interview preparation notes**
