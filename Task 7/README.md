# Task 7 - Breast Cancer Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify breast cancer cases as **benign** or **malignant** using the `breast-cancer.csv` dataset. The implementation is done in Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

The goal is to:
- Understand and preprocess medical data.
- Apply classification algorithms (such as SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
- **File:** `breast-cancer.csv`
- **Description:** Contains medical features (such as cell size, texture, etc.) used to predict cancer type.
- **Target Variable:** Cancer diagnosis (Benign / Malignant).

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps
1. **Load and Explore Data**
   - Import dataset
   - Check data types, missing values, and distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize or standardize features

3. **Model Building**
   - Train different classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix and classification report

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize performance and suggest improvements

If you want, I can also **automatically extract dataset stats from `breast-cancer.csv`** and fill the README with real column names, sample values, and target distribution so itâ€™s more complete.  
Do you want me to do that?
